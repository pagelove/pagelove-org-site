                    We're rebuilding the web, as it was supposed to be.

                    Do you do systems engineering, and build great software in Rust, Go, or C? Or
                    perhaps you're a frontend developer who loves the purity of HTML &amp; CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe the web can be beautiful again, and we're looking for people who share 
                    that vision.
                <p>
                    We're recruiting web server experts, database experts, filesystem experts, and frontend
                    developers; in all cases, we need people who don't conform to the orthadoxy; people who
                    can think outside of the box, to build something truly special that <em>no-one</em> has
                    built before.

                    Pagelove is a startup based in the UK, and we're rebuilding the web, as it was supposed to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vision that Tim Berners-Lee had, of a web that allowed anybody to publish their information
                    is still valid, and still beautiful. Pagelove is working to deliver that vision in an environment
                    that feels magical.
